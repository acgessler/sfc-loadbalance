sfc-loadbalance
===============

WebGL/JS Demo to showcase Load-Balancing for non-homogenous Molecule Simulation using Hilbert-Style Space Filling Curves.

__Run it [online here](http://acgessler.github.io/sfc-loadbalance/LoadBalancePresentation.html).__

To run locally, execute `testserver.py` in the root folder and navigate to `http://localhost/LoadBalancePresentation.html` 
in either Chrome (recommended) or Firefox. WebGL support and a decent graphics card is required.

All it does is to fake a possible run of a non-homogenous Molecule Dynamics Simulation using Cell-linked lists and to run load-balancing based on
SFC on it. It shows some useful properties, as well as an estimate of the communication cost involved.
